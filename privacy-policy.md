# Privacy Policy

Dr.Math takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Collection of Routine Information

This app tracks basic information about its users. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, app details, timestamps, and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific users. The information is collected for routine administration, analytics, and maintenance purposes.
Additionally, Dr.Math may collect user-provided data such as name, email address, and any other information necessary for account creation, in-app purchases, and providing personalized services within the app.

## In-App Purchases and Payment Processing

Dr.Math provides in-app purchases and payment features through trusted third-party services such as Paymob and the official Google Play In-App Billing system.
We do not directly collect or store your payment details â€” all transactions are processed securely through these third-party providers under their own privacy policies.

## Notifications

This app uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications to users. These notifications may include updates, reminders, or promotional content. You can disable notifications anytime from your device settings.

## Cookies

Where necessary, this app may use cookies or similar technologies to store information about user preferences and activity, to enhance user experience and present personalized content.

## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

Third-party services integrated into this app (such as Paymob or Firebase) may use their own cookies, SDKs, or tracking technologies to process data in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Dr.Math does not control how these third parties collect or use data.

## Links to Third Party Websites

We may include links to external websites or resources for user convenience. Dr.Math Team is not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of any website they visit.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 27, 2025, and will remain in effect except for any future updates, which will be effective immediately upon posting on this page.

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any significant changes will be communicated through email or an in-app notice.
